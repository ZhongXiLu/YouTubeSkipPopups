# YouTubeSkipPopups

Chrome extension that skips all the popups when visiting youtube for the first time.

I like to open some video's in incognito so my recommended video's don't get all messed up.
Though, whenever you open a youtube video in incognito, youtube first shows you a cookie consent followed by some popup to login/create an account.
This extension automates this process, by automatically accepting the consent and ignoring the login popup.
